Description: LORIS is a web-based data management software. 
 It is an OPEN SOURCE framework for storing and processing behavioural, 
 clinical, neuroimaging and genetic data. LORIS also makes it easy to manage 
 large datasets acquired over time in a longitudinal study, or at different 
 locations in a large multi-site study.
